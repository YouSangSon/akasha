**Persistent memory for AI coding agents — free, local, self-hosted.**

Attach it to Claude Code, Codex CLI, or any MCP client and the agent
gains durable, searchable memory across sessions: decisions, constraints,
summaries. Postgres for canonical state, Qdrant for vector search, ONNX
embeddings running locally — **no API key required**, `$0` cost, your
data stays on your box.

> Named after the *Akashic records* — the mythical compendium of all
> knowledge. Akasha is where your agents write down what's worth remembering.

## How does it compare?

| | **Akasha** | doobidoo/mcp-memory-service | coleam00/mcp-mem0 | mem0ai/mem0 | letta-ai/letta | getzep/zep |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Free out of the box** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ (OpenAI) | ❌ (OpenAI default) | ❌ (hosted) | ❌ (Cloud SaaS) |
| **Data stays on your box** | ✅ | ✅ | partial (OpenAI calls) | partial (OpenAI calls) | ❌ (Letta Cloud) | ❌ (Zep Cloud) |
| **MCP-native protocol** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (wraps Mem0) | wrapper only | wrapper only | ❌ |
| **Multi-tenant out of the box** | ✅ (`organization_id`, token-org binding, SQL + vector filters) | ❌ | inherits Mem0 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Postgres + vector backend** | ✅ (Qdrant default; pgvector option for Postgres-only deploy) | SQLite-vec | Supabase + pgvector | varies | varies | proprietary |
| **OSS path actively maintained** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (template repo) | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ (CE deprecated 2025) |

The MCP memory ecosystem norm is *free/local default* — doobidoo (1.7k★) headlines
`$0` cost, and the convergent free embedding model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) is what
Akasha uses too. Where Akasha distinctively goes further: a
**Postgres canonical store separate from the vector index** (so a Qdrant
collection rebuild loses 0 data and reindex is one tool call), **org-scoped
multi-tenancy at the SQL and vector layers** (peers either skip it or rely on
the upstream framework), and **MCP-native rather than wrapper** (no shim
between the protocol and the memory engine). For deployments where running a
second service is inconvenient, set `VECTOR_BACKEND=pgvector` to store vectors
in Postgres itself — no Qdrant required.

If you need a hosted memory product with a polished UI, look at Mem0 or Letta.
If you need a self-hosted memory MCP server with no API key required, this is
that.

## Features

Beyond the free/local/multi-tenant basics above, Akasha is built to be
operated in production:

- **Canonical store, derived index.** Postgres holds the truth; the vector
  index is rebuildable. A wiped vector index costs 0 data — one
  `reindex_memory` tool call re-embeds Postgres chunks in bounded pages.
- **Crash-safe ingest.** Writes record a write-ahead intent before touching the
  vector store; a background sweeper retries any upsert that failed mid-flight
  (visibility-timeout claim, `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`). No silent index drift.
- **Secrets scrubbed at write.** Content is scanned before it ever lands —
  API keys, PEM blocks, bearer tokens, and JWTs are rejected (`SecretDetectedError`)
  rather than persisted.
- **Compaction with a dry run.** Exact + semantic dedup and time-decay archival
  are previewed by default (`dryRun: true`); apply is idempotent and
  rate-limited. Archived records are restorable via `unarchive_memory`.
- **Audited and rate-limited.** Every tool call lands in an org-scoped audit log;
  per-token rate limits protect the HTTP API.
- **Dual MCP transports plus JSON HTTP.** MCP clients can use stdio or
  Streamable HTTP at `POST /mcp`; scripts and non-MCP clients can keep using
  JSON HTTP under `/v1/*`.
- **Memory governance UI.** Operators can review, edit, tag, and archive
  records from the static `/admin/memory` shell while all data calls still go
  through the authenticated `/v1/*` API.
- **Production health probes.** `/healthz` (liveness) and a dependency-aware
  `/readyz` (readiness) drive Kubernetes / load-balancer health checks.
- **Pluggable vector backend.** Qdrant by default, or `VECTOR_BACKEND=pgvector`
  to run on Postgres alone.

## Why

Conversations with coding agents lose context the moment the session ends.
Akasha is the place those agents save what's worth remembering and
read it back next time. The same 11 core service tools are exposed over MCP
stdio, MCP Streamable HTTP at `POST /mcp`, and JSON-HTTP under `/v1/*` — full
request/response schemas live in
[docs/api-reference.md](docs/api-reference.md).
HTTP and MCP share that service schema surface, so validation and
payload shapes stay aligned across both transports. MCP additionally exposes
client-context helpers for workspace roots, user elicitation, and sampling when
the connected client advertises those capabilities.

| Tool | What it does | HTTP route |
|------|--------------|------------|
| `add_memory` | Save a decision, fact, or summary (secret-scrubbed at write) | `POST /v1/memory` |
| `search_memory` | Hybrid vector + lexical scope-filtered retrieval | `POST /v1/memory/search` |
| `build_context_pack` | Generate a compact pack to seed a new session | `POST /v1/memory/context-pack` |
| `compact_memory` | Prune duplicates and decayed records (apply or dry-run) | `POST /v1/memory/compact` |
| `reindex_memory` | Rebuild the vector index from Postgres (0 data loss) | `POST /v1/memory/reindex` |
| `list_memory` | Review canonical records with tag / archived filters | `POST /v1/memory/list` |
| `update_memory` | Edit one canonical record and refresh its vector state | `POST /v1/memory/update` |
| `delete_memory` | Governance archive of one record plus vector cleanup | `POST /v1/memory/delete` |
| `tag_memory` | Replace governance tags on one record | `POST /v1/memory/tag` |
| `unarchive_memory` | Restore archived records for forensic recovery | `POST /v1/memory/unarchive` |
| `list_audit_log` | Read the audit trail for compliance / debugging | `POST /v1/audit/list` |

MCP-only context tools: `list_workspace_roots` reads client-advertised roots,
`add_memory_interactive` uses MCP elicitation to collect and store
user-confirmed memory, and `classify_memory_candidate` uses MCP sampling to
suggest a memory kind and summary.

Multi-tenant (`organization_id` per record), bearer-token authenticated,
audit-logged, and rate-limited. Designed to run as a single-user MCP server
on your laptop or a multi-team backend in your infra. Personal users can
ignore orgs entirely — see
[Personal / single-tenant use](docs/configuration.md#personal--single-tenant-use).

## Quick start

Requires Docker (for Postgres + Qdrant) and Node.js ≥ 20.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YouSangSon/akasha.git
cd akasha

# 1. Copy the env template (defaults work — OPENAI_API_KEY only needed if
#    you set EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai later).
cp .env.example .env
${EDITOR:-nano} .env

# 2. Bring up Postgres + Qdrant + run migrations + build.
./install.sh

# 3. Point your MCP client at the generated config snippets:
cat .akasha/mcp/claude-desktop.json
cat .akasha/mcp/codex.toml

# Optional lifecycle helpers for hosts that support session hooks:
.akasha/hooks/session-start.sh "continue implementation"
printf '%s\n' "Summary: durable outcome ..." | .akasha/hooks/session-end.sh
```

## Worked example

Save a decision, search it back, then build a pack to seed a fresh session —
over the HTTP API (the MCP tools take the same fields). Responses are
abbreviated for illustration.

```bash
TOKEN=$MEMORY_API_TOKENS   # from your .env

# 1. Save a memory.
curl -sX POST http://localhost:8787/v1/memory \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"projectKey":"checkout","kind":"decision",
       "content":"Use idempotency keys on POST /charge to make retries safe."}'
# → {"success":true,"data":{"ok":true,"memoryId":"project:checkout:42",
#                           "summary":"Use idempotency keys on POST /charge…"}}

# 2. Search semantically — no keyword match needed.
curl -sX POST http://localhost:8787/v1/memory/search \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"projectKey":"checkout","query":"how do we avoid double-charging?"}'
# → {"success":true,"data":{"ok":true,"results":[
#      {"id":42,"memoryType":"decision",
#       "content":"Use idempotency keys on POST /charge…"}]}}

# 3. Build a context pack to paste into a new agent session.
curl -sX POST http://localhost:8787/v1/memory/context-pack \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"projectKey":"checkout","task":"add refund endpoint"}'
# → data.packMarkdown is ready to drop into your prompt.
```

## Architecture

| Layer | Responsibility |
|-------|----------------|
| MCP server (`src/mcp/`) | Shared MCP server surface: tool descriptors, schemas, registry, and handlers |
| HTTP server (`src/app/`) | Serves MCP Streamable HTTP at `/mcp` plus JSON HTTP under `/v1/*` |
| Canonical store (`src/store/memory-repository.ts`) | Postgres — records, sources, ingest jobs, entity graph, audit |
| Vector index (`src/vector/`) | Qdrant (default) or pgvector — chunked embeddings + similarity search. Set `VECTOR_BACKEND=pgvector` for Postgres-only deploy. |
| Compaction (`src/compact/`) | Dedup (exact + semantic), decay, archive, unarchive, sweeper |
| Embeddings (`src/embedding/`) | `transformers` (free local ONNX, default), `openai` (`text-embedding-3-small`), or `local` (deterministic stub for CI) |

Data flow: caller writes `add_memory` → record persisted to Postgres, entity
mentions linked, content chunked + embedded + upserted to the active vector
backend. `search_memory` → embed query → vector similarity + Postgres
FTS/entity lexical search → hydrate → rank → return. See
[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for design details.

## Configuration

All knobs are env vars. The three a first-timer usually touches:

| Var | Default | Purpose |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `MEMORY_API_TOKENS` | _(required unless OAuth JWT validation is configured)_ | Static bearer tokens for the HTTP API; `token:org` binds a token to an org |
| `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER` | `transformers` | `transformers` (free local ONNX), `openai`, or `local` (CI stub) |
| `VECTOR_BACKEND` | `qdrant` | `qdrant`, or `pgvector` for a Postgres-only deploy |

`OPENAI_API_KEY` is optional — only needed when `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai`.
Everything else has sensible defaults. See [.env.example](.env.example) for the
complete list and [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md) for types,
defaults, and examples.

## Common commands

```bash
npm run dev:server    # HTTP API in watch mode
npm run dev:mcp       # MCP stdio server in watch mode
npm run dev:cli       # CLI in watch mode
npm run lifecycle:init -- --project my-project --organization-id default
npm run typecheck     # tsc --noEmit
npm run test          # vitest run
npm run db:migrate    # apply pending migrations
npm run backup:create # backend-aware backup for VECTOR_BACKEND
npm run backup:create:pgvector # explicit Postgres-only pgvector backup
```

With `VECTOR_BACKEND=qdrant`, `backup:create` captures Postgres plus a Qdrant
snapshot. With `VECTOR_BACKEND=pgvector`, logical vector data lives in Postgres,
so `backup:create` skips `scripts/snapshot-qdrant.sh` and does not require
`QDRANT_URL`. Set `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY_FILE` to encrypt backup artifacts with
AES-256-GCM before any off-host copy.
