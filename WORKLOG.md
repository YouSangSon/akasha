# WORKLOG

## 2026-06-27

- Read project rules, README, contributing guide, architecture/config docs,
  docs index, package scripts, CI, and test layout.
- Confirmed no repo-local `CLAUDE.md` or `.agents/skills/` directory exists.
- Implemented goal-run hardening and documentation refresh in the active branch.
- Added sweeper metrics for compaction and ingest loops.
- Added `/metrics` background queue backlog gauges and partial indexes to avoid
  historical-row scans.
- Added dedicated background worker lifecycle:
  - `src/app/background-workers.ts`
  - `src/app/worker.ts`
  - `npm run dev:worker`
  - `npm run start:worker`
- Fixed review findings:
  - HTTP executable shutdown now awaits worker/probe cleanup via
    `closeOperatorServer()`.
  - Worker startup now happens only after HTTP bind succeeds.
  - Listen failure cleans the probe pool and does not start workers.
- Focused worker tests passed:
  `npm test -- tests/app/background-workers.test.ts tests/app/start-background-workers-server.test.ts tests/app/worker.test.ts tests/app/start-operator-server-metrics.test.ts`.
- Web/GitHub research:
  - Node HTTP docs confirmed `server.close()` handles HTTP close, while
    Akasha-owned worker/pool cleanup needs an app wrapper:
    https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#serverclosecallback
  - Redis `agent-memory-server` uses separate production API and background
    worker processes, matching the dedicated worker topology:
    https://github.com/redis/agent-memory-server
  - Node release data shows Node 20 is EOL as of 2026-04-30; added a backlog
    item to move runtime/CI support to active LTS lines:
    https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule

Next:
- Commit locally.

## 2026-06-28

- Implemented Node runtime support update:
  - `package.json` and root lock metadata now require Node `>=22`.
  - `@types/node` now targets the Node 22 line so TypeScript cannot silently
    admit Node 24-only APIs while package support starts at Node 22.
  - GitHub Actions CI now runs Node 22 and 24.
  - README badges/quick-start docs, troubleshooting docs, and `install.sh`
    now state/enforce Node.js >= 22.
  - Public docs drift tests now guard package metadata, lock metadata, README
    badges, troubleshooting docs, CI matrix, and installer runtime checks.
- Review gates:
  - Spec compliance passed.
  - Quality review initially caught Node 24 type definitions and missing
    installer drift coverage; both were fixed and re-review approved.
- Implemented repo secret hygiene guard:
  - Added `tests/scripts/repo-secret-hygiene.test.ts` to scan `git ls-files`
    text files with Akasha's existing `scanForSecrets` helper.
  - Failure output is limited to file path and secret category; matched values
    are never reported.
  - Excluded the detector source and scrubber unit test, where regexes and
    examples are intentional.
  - Allowed only exact placeholder DB URL userinfo pairs such as
    `memory:memory`, `user:pass`, `user:pw`, `postgres:test`, `memory:STRONG_PW`,
    and the exact `${POSTGRES_USER:-memory}:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:-memory}` form;
    other embedded DB credentials still fail.
  - Split synthetic AWS/GitHub secret-shaped literals in non-scrubber store
    tests into runtime string fragments.
  - Review gates:
    - Spec compliance passed.
    - Quality review caught broad DB credential allowlisting and untracked test
      risk; both were fixed before final verification.
- Source rationale:
  - GitHub push protection blocks hardcoded credentials before they reach a
    repository, including test/fixture-shaped tokens:
    https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/concepts/secret-security/push-protection
  - OWASP Secrets Management calls out API keys, database credentials, SSH
    keys, certificates, and similar secrets hardcoded in source/config as a
    common leak source:
    https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Secrets_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html

- Reviewed the backup/restore runbooks against the current Qdrant and pgvector
  paths.
  - `scripts/restore-smoke.ts` now passes the backup manifest's
    `qdrant.collectionName` to restore commands as
    `RESTORE_SMOKE_QDRANT_COLLECTION_NAME`, falling back to
    `QDRANT_COLLECTION_NAME` or `memory_chunks_v1` for older manifests.
  - The self-hosted restore examples now upload Qdrant snapshots to the
    manifest-derived collection and use `priority=snapshot`.
  - Public docs drift coverage now pins the restore command away from hardcoded
    `memory_chunks_v1`.
- Source rationale:
  - Qdrant's snapshot API recovers uploaded snapshots through the collection
    scoped `/collections/{collection_name}/snapshots/upload` endpoint and
    supports `priority=snapshot` for snapshot-led recovery:
    https://api.qdrant.tech/api-reference/snapshots/recover-from-uploaded-snapshot
