# WORKLOG

## 2026-06-27

- Read project rules, README, contributing guide, architecture/config docs,
  docs index, package scripts, CI, and test layout.
- Confirmed no repo-local `CLAUDE.md` or `.agents/skills/` directory exists.
- Implemented goal-run hardening and documentation refresh in the active branch.
- Added sweeper metrics for compaction and ingest loops.
- Added `/metrics` background queue backlog gauges and partial indexes to avoid
  historical-row scans.
- Added dedicated background worker lifecycle:
  - `src/app/background-workers.ts`
  - `src/app/worker.ts`
  - `npm run dev:worker`
  - `npm run start:worker`
- Fixed review findings:
  - HTTP executable shutdown now awaits worker/probe cleanup via
    `closeOperatorServer()`.
  - Worker startup now happens only after HTTP bind succeeds.
  - Listen failure cleans the probe pool and does not start workers.
- Focused worker tests passed:
  `npm test -- tests/app/background-workers.test.ts tests/app/start-background-workers-server.test.ts tests/app/worker.test.ts tests/app/start-operator-server-metrics.test.ts`.
- Web/GitHub research:
  - Node HTTP docs confirmed `server.close()` handles HTTP close, while
    Akasha-owned worker/pool cleanup needs an app wrapper:
    https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#serverclosecallback
  - Redis `agent-memory-server` uses separate production API and background
    worker processes, matching the dedicated worker topology:
    https://github.com/redis/agent-memory-server
  - Node release data shows Node 20 is EOL as of 2026-04-30; added a backlog
    item to move runtime/CI support to active LTS lines:
    https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule

Next:
- Commit locally.
